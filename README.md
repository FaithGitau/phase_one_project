**Project about making movies**


This project uses exploratory data analysis to get insights and recommendations for a business stakeholder (Microsoft) wanting to venture in to the field of movie making.


**Overview**

Filmmaking or film production is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, beginning with an initial story, idea, or commission.
The film production process can be divided into countless steps to take a film from concept to a finished piece. There are three key stages that take place in the production of any film: pre-production (planning), production (filming), and post-production (editing, color-grading, and visual effects). However, a few of the common factors that contribute to a successful film include: a compelling storyline; a well written script; great actors who have a reach to the audience; a visionary director alongside a director of photography and editor. among other factors.
**Business Problem**

My project's aim is to assist the head of Microsoft's new movie studio with insights that would help them decide what type of films to create based on the currently trending movies, movie ratings and genres. Microsoft may be able to know the type of movies to create based on the above factors, calculating the cost of production, as well as understanding their target audience

**Data**

In this project I'll be using movie datasets from IMDB and Box Office Mojo which are online databases of information related to films, television series, podcasts, etc. The data files provide the start year, ratings, movie titles as well as other features like the genres and running time of the movies over the last decades.

**Methods**

In this project, I'll be using exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder (Microsoft) about what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

**Results**

The above diagram indicate that Documentary films have the highest number of votes followed by Drama.


**Conclusions**

This analysis yields to three recommendations that would help Microsoft to decide what type of films to create.

* **Invest in making movie genres that reach a bigger audience**
Investing in films/movies like Drama, Comedy, Action and Documentary will ensure high number of audience as they are the ones with the highest number of votes and ratings from our data. Identify target audiences and demographics to tailor content and marketing efforts. Also, evaluate market trends, including IMDB performance, streaming services like NETFLIX and viewer preferences.

* **Average Runtime**
The average runtime for the movies is 87 minutes. Top rated movies are longer around 140 - 160 minutes. I'ld recommend aiming for about a 2hours movies as that appears to be the right duration for even movies in cinemas.

* **Sustainable Practices**
Embrace sustainable filmmaking practices to reduce environmental impact and save on production costs. Examine revenue and profit margins for various types of movies and assess the cost-effectiveness of marketing and distribution strategies.

**Next Steps**

Further analyses could yield additional insights to further help the head of Microsoft's new movie studio in making decision on the type of movies to produce.

* **Audience engagement through social media**
Utilize social media analytics to understand audience sentiment and engagement. Investigate the use of audience data for personalized recommendations.

* **Content production**
Evaluate the performance of directors, actors, and creative teams. Analyze the relationship between production budgets and box office success.

* **Assessing risks and challenges**
Analyze potential risks and challenges, such as pandemic impacts, legal disputes, and content controversies and develop risk mitigation strategies.
